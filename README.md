# Interactive Star Wars RPG
This is a simple Role Playing Game where you select a Star Wars character and battle foes.

Please check out the deployed app on Heroku [here](https://simple-star-wars-rpg.herokuapp.com/)!

The characters attack points increase with each attack, so battle each of the foes in a strategic order to win.

# Technologies Learned
This game was my first exposure to using jQuery for DOM manipulation.
The gameplay logic is done entirely with client-side JavaScript.
